# Problem Statement
**The Problem** is a lack of inventory management from field, to crate, to storage, to market and thus, increaing waste of produce and lack of produce being sent to market.

**It affects** company itself, due to mismanagement of inventory, the managers, as it is more difficult to keep track of what is and is not needed, the employees, who may feel their work is inadequate due to waste, the customers, who are not recieving the appropriate produce at markets.

**A successful solution** would be to setup a database containing information about what space is available, what and when crops are being sown, estimated yield, estimated produce to be sent to markets, actual produce that is sent to markets, return produce from markets and finally waste.
